                                exported previously.  This new Dashboard is a duplication of 
                                the original, with no relationship between them.  When 
                                exporting a Dashboard, it looses all Permissions and Snapshots.  
                                After importing, the new Dashboard is only visible and editable 
                                by yourself.  You need to re-assign permissions for other users
