                            Note: A Dashboard can be exported as a plain text file.  This file can
                            be imported.  This new Dashboard is a duplication of the original, with
                            no relationship between them.  When exporting a Dashboard, it looses all
                            Permissions and Snapshots.  After importing, the new Dashboard is only
                            visible and editable by yourself.  You need to re-assign permissions for
                            other users who need to view or edit it.
