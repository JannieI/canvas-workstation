                        Note: The Datasource associated with this Widget is large, and may take a while
                        to Refresh.  While running, it will indicate 'Query Running' in the Statusbar
                        at the bottom of the screen.  You may stop it by clicking the <b>Cancel</b>
                        button on the Statusbar.  Once the query completes, the graph in the Widget will refresh
                        automatically.  You may have multiple queries running at the same time.
