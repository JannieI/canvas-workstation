                            With the <b>No Security</b> model, all users have full access to all
                            Dashboards.  In a sense, all users have Admin rights to them.  Anyone
                            can create a Dashboard, and all Dashboards can be viewed and editted 
                            by all users.  This model is ideal for standalone installations (where
                            there is only one user) or small teams with a high level of trust.  
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Note that while editing a Dashboard, changes are never applied to the 
                            original. A separate Draft copy is created.  This copy is visible
                            only to the editor, while all other users will see only the original.  
                            The user can use checkpoints (see File -> Checkpoints menu item) to
                            store interim copies.  The user may role back to a previously stored
                            checkpoint at any time.  When the Draft copy is created, the system
                            automatically creates the first checkpoint called 'Original'.  The
                            use of checkpoints is optional.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            During editing, all changes are saved automatically to the Draft copy
                            without any user input.  Once changes have been finalised and the user
                            wants to make these available to other users, he clicks Save.  The Save
                            button will replace the original copy with the Draft copy, and 
                            remove the Draft copy. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Also, only one user at a time may edit a Dashboard. Once changes 
                            have started, the user can Discard these changes (which will 
                            simply delete the Draft copy and all checkpoints). In order to 
                            allocate rights to individual users or groups, the Team security 
                            model must be used.
