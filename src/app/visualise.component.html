Present Dashboards previously created.  Exploration is limited to features already created
and saved during the Design phase.
Use the Arrows at the top of the page to navigate between linked Dashboards.  The List icon 
provides a list of linked Dashboards.  In case there are no linked Dashboards (the Dashboard
is independant), then the Arrows and List icon at the top will be disabled.
<br><br>

When a Widget has visible Arrows, it can be used to show different graphs in the same Widget.
This can be used to drill down to more detail for the current graph.
<br><br>
Open a Dashboard from the Dashboard tab in the Open menu option.
<br><br>
<i>This Viewer is free of charge, and can be used to view Dashboards from the Server, or
    standalone Dashboards (in which case the data is incorporated into the Dashboard, 
    and visible to all).
